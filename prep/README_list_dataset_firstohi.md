- Original_OHI_NC_Layers : this sheet is basically the list of Targets, layers and associated data description used for the first OHI evaluation for NC. Nothing more

- OHI2016_Layers_Review : This sheet is a review of the original OHI NC layers considering what we want for the 2016 OHI proof of concept : A color code helps to understand the review. Basically, the aim here is to narrow down what we have, what we want and what we need in terms of Data.

Some data pooare just listed as "pressure" or "resilience" or "spatial" but they don't fall into any goals or subgoals  and are just listed as target. What about these ? Is there any set of data we should use as well for these ?

- 2016_Goals-Component_Review : This sheet is a review of the OHI NC components for each goals that are appropriate for our context/region and that we can use for the 2016 OHI proof of concept. A color code helps to understand the review and the aim here is the same as previously, try to narrow down what we have, what we want and what we need. 

Please note that for now, i don't totally understand the link between "components" and "Layers". Where "Layers" looks like proper data (with values and units), i don't always see what components are built from (data ? Pool of datas ?). Plus, while goals are filled with many components, only few layers seems to be used for the same goals...If you could help clarified, it might be of a great help ! 

- OHI2016_Selected_Comp-layers : This is simply to pivot table to show up the component/layers we should focus on for each goal. This comes from the reviews. 

- Existing_DATA_List_DAM : This last sheet is a listing of all the data that are potentially available locally and might be of use. It is a review we did with Julie. Please note that we already have some of these data (fisheries for ex), other are available but might need a bit of work for Julie to put these together and send it on. Some data will need us to contact other agencies (might take a little more time).
